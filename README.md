### 2. Twitter Sentiment Analysis - EDA and Modeling
**File:** `twitter-sentiment-extaction-analysis-eda-and-model.ipynb`

A practical sentiment analysis project with comprehensive exploratory data analysis:

**üìà Dataset Overview**
- **Total samples:** 27,480 labeled tweets
- **Sentiment distribution:**
  - Neutral: 11,117 samples
  - Positive: 8,582 samples  
  - Negative: 7,781 samples

**üîç Key Analysis Features**
